# Technology

Hackweeks are highly technical in nature. We utilize multiple tools to facilitate full participation by all organizing team members and participants. You will learn to use automated workflows in GitHub to generate consistent and quality controlled Jupyter Notebooks that are converted to a public website. In addition, we aim to highlight the contributions of all organizers by highlighting their contributions on the event website. Finally we will discuss best practices for working collaboratively on projects during and after a hackweek.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, hackweek organizers and participants will:

* be familiar with the suite of technology used during a UW Hackweek (GitHub, Jupyter Hub, Jupyter Book)
* understand recommended tools for tutorial creation and project work
* know where to go for technology support before and during the hackweek

Specific walk-throughs are provided for:
* how to effectively share data and code during and after a hackweek
* adding yourself to the event website as a member of the organizing team
