# Resources for Organizers

The eScience Institute supports Community Partners in planning each hackweek. We invite organizers to participate in video and live training sessions tailored to each of the Community Partner roles. Upon completion of the training, organizer profiles will be posted on the hackweek website along with badge(s) representing their roles in the event.

## Project Consultant Schedule

The [Project Consultant](../services/project-consultant.md) has a big-picture view of the possible scope of projects for the hackweek community, and helps participants get clear on project ideas and objectives. Project Consultants are asked to participate in a virtual training session, and to begin assisting participants in advance of the event:

```{Admonition} Week -4 (60 min): Project Consultant Orientation
Learn our approach for setting up and guiding project work; discuss approaches for fostering project ideas for this specific community.
```

```{Admonition} Week -3 to -1: Guiding Project Ideation
:class: tip
Communicate with participants on Slack, encouraging project pitching and ideation prior to the hackweek.
```

```{Admonition} Hackweek

```

## Helper Schedule

Helpers are critical to keeping a hackweek running smoothly and sharing information among participants and organizers. Helpers are asked to attend a virtual training session shortly before the hackweek:

```{Admonition} Week -1 (90 min): Helper Orientation
Learn best practices for giving help to learners in a virtual and in-person environment; discuss schedule and helper opportunities; sign up for specific times.
```

```{Admonition} Hackweek
Attend the tutorial(s) or project(s) for which you'd like to offer help.
```
